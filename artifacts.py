# key pieces of data to collect

# artifact groups are identified uniquely within an execution by composite key
# * name
# * type

# artifact files within each group are identified uniquely by filename and graph node
# * filename
# * graph node
# * artifact group (foreign key)
# NOTE: there is an edge case where different outputs in the same node could be annotated identically - we'll require validation to prevent this

# the problem is the way that Flyte stores metadata and how the existing development experience works
# it makes it cumbersome to place artifacts into specific groups b/c of how the Python types are defined

# we need to change the DX because:
# it's error-prone
# requires specifying the group values as partitions again and again
# requires more code than should be necessary, including predefining Artifacts by name instead of inside the Annotation
# the name of the artifact should be able to automatically set the extension (used by frontend for file previews)

# also note its worth investigating behavior dynamic partitions - i.e. ReportArtifact.create_from()

# upstream code here shows some examples
# https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/master/flytekit/core/artifact.py#L371
# https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/master/tests/flytekit/unit/core/test_artifacts.py
